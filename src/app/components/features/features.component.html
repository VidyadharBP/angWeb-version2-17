        <h2>Components</h2>
        <p class="fs-6">Components are the fundamental building blocks of user interfaces in Angular applications. They contains a specific view and its related logic, promoting modularity, reusability, and maintainability within our code.</p>
        <p class="fs-6">Components are the logical piece of code contains the bussiness logic each component consist of Template, Class, MetaData</p>
             <p class="fs-6">Template : Contains View displayed on the Dom. Defines the visual layout of the component using HTML elements and directives and Implements the component's behavior and interacts with data and other components.</p>
             <p class="fs-6"> Class : Contains the bussiness logic properties and methods and this will support the View</p>
             <p class="fs-6"> MetaData : It tells about extra information about the component like template,style etc</p>
             <p class="fs-6">CSS styles (optional): Styles the appearance of the component.</p>

        <h2>Modules</h2>
        <p class="fs-6">Modules are the building block of application they contains the information of Components,Service and if they are using other module then there information</p>
        <p class="fs-6">Every application consist of at least one module that is Root Module that bootstraps our application</p>
        <p class="fs-6">we have Feature modules These modules they represent features or functionalities within our application They import necessary components, directives, services, and pipes specific to that feature</p>
        <p class="fs-6">
          In Angular, modules play a crucial role in organizing and structuring your application code. They serve as containers that group related components, directives, pipes, and services, ensuring modularity, maintainability, and reusability.</p>
          <h2>Types of modules:</h2>
          <p class="fs-6">Root module : The main module bootstrapping your application. It usually imports the BrowserModule and defines the root component that acts as the entry point.</p>
          <p class="fs-6">Feature modules: Modules grouping components, directives, pipes, and services related to a specific feature or functionality. These modules can be lazy loaded as needed.</p>
          <p class="fs-6">Shared modules: Modules containing reusable components, directives, and pipes that can be shared across different features.</p>

        <h2>Directives</h2>
        <p class="fs-6">Directives are the custom html element they are used to add or remove the element and we can make the change on the element.</p>
        <p class="fs-6"> directives are special classes that add new behavior or modify existing behavior of elements in your templates. </p>
        <p class="fs-6">Directives will power up the html</p>
        <h2>Types of Directives </h2>
        <p class="fs-5">1 : Structural Directives :- These directives manipulate the layout of our DOM by adding, removing, or transforming elements based on certain conditions.</p>
        <p class="fs-6">*ngIf: conditionally includes or removes an element based on a boolean expression.</p>
        <p class="fs-6">*ngFor: iterates over a collection and creates a template for each item.</p>
        <p class="fs-6">*ngSwitch: displays different templates based on the value of an expression.</p>
        <p class="fs-5">2 : Attribute Directives:- These directives modify the appearance or behavior of individual elements.</p>
        <p class="fs-6">[routerLink]: adds navigation capabilities to elements linked to different routes.</p>
        <p class="fs-6">[disabled]: disables an element based on a boolean expression.</p>
        <p class="fs-6">[style.color]: dynamically sets the color of an element's text.</p>
        <p class="fs-5">3 : Component Directives:- hese directives are essentially components themselves, but are used for specific purposes</p>
        <p class="fs-6">ngModel: enables two-way data binding between form elements and component properties.</p>
        <p class="fs-6">router-outlet: defines where routed components are inserted in the DOM.</p>

              <h2>*ngIf</h2>
              <p class="fs-6">
                NgIf is a structural directive in Angular that conditionally includes or removes a template based on the truthy value of an expression. It's commonly used to control the visibility of elements in your HTML template, making your UI dynamic and reactive.</p>
                <p class="fs-6">*ngIf tells Angular to evaluate the condition expression. If the expression is truthy the content within the element will be included in the DOM. Otherwise, it will be removed.</p>

        <p class="fs-6">Angular compiles our templates into equivalent TypeScript code and then that TypeScript code is compiled to JavaScript and then the result is rendered to users.  So Ivy renderer is the new rendering engine which is basically designed to support backward compatibility with existing renderers and then also focused to improve the speed of rendering and it also optimized the size of the final package In Angular, it will not be the default renderer but we can manually enable it using the compiler options.</p>

        <h2>Service Worker Support</h2>
        <p class="fs-6">Service workers are basically scripts which run in the web browser and manage to cache an application. Service workers were first introduced in Angular 5. In Angular 6, service workers come with some bug fixes, including some new functionalities. So when we deploy the latest version of the application, we may need to deactivate or uninstall the existing service workers. In Angular 5, there is no straightforward option for doing this, but Angular 6 brings this functionality with the new script file named safety-worker.js, which is actually a part of the production bundle which helps us to unregister the existing service worker</p>

        <p class="fs-6">Lazy loading is based on the concepts of Angular Routing it helps to bring down the size of large files by lazily loading the modules that are required. In previous angular versions, the route configuration uses the property "loadChildren" which accepts a string and if there was a wrong module name or any typo while writing the code, Angular would not consider it wrong and accept whatever value was there as a string until we try building it So to overcome this it added the support for dynamic imports in router configuration</p>

        <h2>Other Updates</h2>
        <p class="fs-5">Performance Improvements</p>
        <p class="fs-6" >Angular 10 has witnessed a reduction in the size of the entry-points, leading to an improvement in performance. The caching of the dependencies and the calculation of basePaths further aids in improving the performance.</p>
        <p class="fs-5" >Compiler Update</p>
        <p class="fs-6" >The latest Angular version has added a compiler interface that wraps the actual ngtsc compiler. There are some additional features to the metadata like the Dependency information, ng-content selectors, Angular Language Service. These features propagate  the precise cost span in an ExpressionBinding of a micro syntax expression.</p>
        <p class="fs-5" >Ngcc</p>
        <p class="fs-6" >The usage of the A Program-based entry-point finder in Angular 10 helps the entry-point finder to reach a program that is characterized by a tsconfig.json record. This choice catalyzes the cycle in places that are introduced with a relatively small number of entry points brought into that application. Consequently, this helps in manifesting and reducing the file size of the entry-point.</p>

        <h2>Updated HMR Support</h2>
        <p class="fs-6">HMR or Hot Module Replacement is an mechanism that allows the replacement of modules without a browser refresh HMR has been around in the last few versions of Angular and developers have used it to simplify their experience Angular 11 improves on all previous versions to offer support to incorporate and enable HMR to initiate an application</p>
        <p class="fs-5">The following command will get developers started </p>
        <p class="fs-6">ng serve --hmr </p>

        <h2>Improved Logging and Reporting</h2>
        <p class="fs-6">The Component Test Harnesses gives a powerful and clear API surface that assists with testing the Angular Material components. It gives an approach to developers to communicate with Angular Material parts by utilizing the upheld API while testing. This feature was first introduced in Angular 9.  The difference between Angular 9 and Angular 11 with the Component Test Harnesses is that Angular 11 comes with a parallel function, performance improvements, and new APIs. The manual change detection function, helps the developers to disable the automatic change detection in unit tests as well as access the finer-grained control of change detection.</p>

        <h2>Ivy Everywhere</h2>
        <p class="fs-6">Angular 12 is finally deprecating its old legacy compilation and rendering pipeline called the View Engine. The next release will eliminate the rendering pipeline. Libraries previously working with View Engine will then function with Ivy.With the help of a compatibility compiler and a smooth update path, the entire ecosystem will shift to Ivy and it will make Angular 12 much more efficient.</p>

        <h2>Migrating from legacy i18n message IDs</h2>
        <p class="fs-6">Since Angular version 11, new tasks are normally intended to use the new message ids and they as of now have the tooling to move existing endeavors with existing interpretations. In the current version, there are diverse legacy message-id plans being used in the i18n system. These inheritance message-ids are fragile as issues can arise subject to whitespace and the getting sorted out organizations and ICU articulations. To handle this issue the community is moving away from them. The new standard message-id configuration is significantly more extreme and common. This arrangement will lessen the pointless interpretation invalidation and related retranslation cost in applications where interpretations don't facilitate due to whitespace changes</p>

Angular 16 has resolved this issue with some significant improvements for server-side rendering and also improved performance, advanced component interaction, streamlined state management, next-generation routing, and enhanced testing and debugging capabilities, Angular 16 offers many opportunities to build powerful and efficient web applications.</p>

        <h2>Angular Signal</h2>
        <p class="fs-6">Signals allows you to retrieve the value (pull) and update or mutate it (push). signal always has a value, and retrieving this value is done synchronously. Angular uses Zone.js for change detection mechanism </p>
        <p class="fs-6">At the start of an Angular application, the framework overrides certain low-level browser APIs, such as addEventListener, using the Zone.js library. Zone.js is responsible for triggering change detection by listening to various events like clicks, mouseovers, HTTP requests, and timers (setTimeout, setInterval).</p> 
        <p class="fs-6">Whenever something changes in our application, a change detection process is performed, and page is refreshed. Angular organizes our application as a component tree, where each component is associated with a change detector. By default, when a change occurs in any child component, the entire tree is re-evaluated, regardless of each components dependencies. This process is called dirty checking. </p>
        <p class="fs-6">Even if your applications change detection is set to OnPush mode, the change detection cycle still traverses the entire component tree. However, with OnPush components that have no change dependencies, they wont be re-evaluated unnecessarily. </p>
        <p class="fs-6">To enhance the performance of Angulars change detection mechanism Signal pattern will be helpful Using signals change detection will occur at the component level only when the associated signal changes, without the need to traverse the entire component tree or rely on Zone.js Using Signal pattern, Angular aims to improve the efficiency of change detection, leading to better performance. </p>

        <p class="fs-6">Angular 16 introduces non-destructive hydration to overcome these problems. With non-destructive hydration, the DOM is not destroyed when the client app is downloaded and bootstrapped. Instead, it enhances the existing DOM. Angular 16 this is currently in the developer preview stage. To enable it, you can include provideClientHydration() as a provider when bootstrapping the application.</p>
